    <h1>Decisions</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Every day, we are faced with hundreds of tiny decisions. They may seem
        insignificant in the moment, but every one helps chart the course for
        the remainder of our lives. Each new pick brings us closer to our
        ultimate fate; each new selection drags us closer to our inescapable
        end. The options unchosen haunt us relentlessly, filling us with longing
        for what might have been; the paths we do choose remind us of our
        powerlessness against the inevitable tide of the universe. Do we have
        free will? Or are we but cogs in the great machine of Nature? Can you
        change your life? Or are you bound to a destiny you cannot control?
